// This quick project was created to show how Diffable DataSource works with network data populating a simple TableView, and is used for learning, there are a lot of comments in project fyi.

// I will be expanding on this building a full fledged Covid Dash App, but wanted to show individual parts. Next example will show Compositional Layout, on top of this.

 // I also have the same project named COVIDTABLEVIEWREGULAR that querys the same api but populates tableView using old indexPath method so that one can quickly see the difference.

// The project query's the free covid19 API at this url: https://covid19api.com/ , returns country data and populates a tableView using Diffable DataSource.  

// The network manager uses swift 5 result type, everything is done programmatically.
